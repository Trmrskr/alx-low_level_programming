# 0x17. C - Doubly linked lists

This directory contains my engineering practice on Doubly linked lists. Several manipulations were carried on the given linked list including printing contents of dll finding the length of the list, before and after node insertion and deletion even at a given index, adding of node at the beginning and end of list, freeing memory used by the doubly linked list, getting node at a particular index, summing the contents of a doubly linked list and the list goes on.
