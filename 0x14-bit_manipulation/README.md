0x14. C - Bit manipulation

This repository contains task practiced on Bit manipulation.

Tasks 0: 0
write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int
File: 0-binary_to_uint.c
Prototype: unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);

Task 1: 1
Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number
File: 1-print_binary.c
